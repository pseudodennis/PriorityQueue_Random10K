> Dale, Joyce, Weems (4th) p578 #9

Use the SortedABPriQ class to help solve the following problem:

Create an application Random10K that generates 100 numbers between 1 and 10,000, stores them in a priority queue
(you can wrap them in an Integer object), and then prints them out in columns 10 integers wide in
a. decreasing order.
b. increasing order.
c. ordered increasingly by the sum of the digits in the number.
